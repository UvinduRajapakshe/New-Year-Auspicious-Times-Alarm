# New-Year-Auspicious-Times-Alarm

* The code defines four Date objects for the specified alarm times: alarm01, alarm02, alarm03Start/alarm03End, and alarm04.

* The code checks the current time against each alarm time using a series of "if" statements. If the current time is before an alarm time, the code schedules a notification for that alarm time.

* The notification title includes the alarm number for easy identification.

* The notification is closed automatically after 10 seconds using the "setTimeout" method of JavaScript.

* If no upcoming alarms are found, the code logs a message to the console.
